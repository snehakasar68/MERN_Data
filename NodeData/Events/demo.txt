The "exports" keyword is used to ensure that the functionality defined in this file can actually be accessed by other files.
We are then defining a function called 'AddNumber'. This function is defined to take 2 parameters, a and b. The function is added to the module "exports" to make the function as a public function that can be accessed by other application modules.
We are finally making our function return the added value of the parameters.
Now that we have created our custom module which has the functionality of adding 2 numbers. It's now time to create an application, which will call this module.

In the next step, we will actually see how to create the application which will call our custom module.
